![Tsunami](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3531f47-0a4f-4d4e-a727-e7ffc00c71c3)

Welcome to the Github Organization page for the Community of Practice focused on New Approach Methodologies in Immunology research.  
Topics of interest include:
- Agent-based model (ABM) simulations and digital twins of tissue-immune microenvironments
- Equation-based models (EBM) for spatiotemporal dynamics of tissue-immune microenvironments
- Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) for equation discovery and model calibration
- Statistical aspects of modeling in silico NAMs, including sensitivity analysis (SA)  and uncertainty quantification (UQ)
